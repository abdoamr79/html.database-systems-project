      Sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state
     
   (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data).
 
   To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously,
   
   where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within
 
   dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database administrator to bring the

   database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state),
  
   these files are used to restore that state.
