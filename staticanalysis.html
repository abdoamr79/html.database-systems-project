        Static analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages.
  
     In particular, the *Abstract interpretation framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support 
  
     sound approximation techniques.The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data.
   
     The abstraction of relational database system has many interesting applications,
  
     in particular, for security purposes, such as fine grained access control, watermarking, etc.

            Understanding the links between application programs and their database is useful in various contexts such as migrating 
     
         information systems towards a new database platform, evolving the database schema, or assessing the overall system quality. In the case of Java systems,
     
         identifying which portion of the source code accesses which portion of the database may prove challenging. Indeed, Java programs typically access their
       
          database in a dynamic way. The queries they send to the database server are built at runtime, through String concatenations, or Object-Relational Mapping frameworks 
      
         like Hibernate and JPA. This paper presents a static analysis approach to program-database links recovery, specifically designed for Java systems.
       
         The approach allows developers to automatically identify the source code locations accessing given database tables and columns.
        
         It focuses on the combined analysis of JDBC, Hibernate and JPA invocations. We report on the use of our approach to analyse three real-life Java systems.
